This is a web-based banking enterprise application. The function provided is as below.

Public user:
A. Search for a banking transaction by type, banking transaction number and banking
transaction name. The search result is shown in tabular format and another option is
provided for user to view the full details of a transaction.
B. Operate a banking transaction including fund transfer and deposit. The transaction
information is stored in the database and can be viewed by above function.

Bank worker:
A. Manage users including add, view, edit and delete both public users and bank
workers.

I adopt Java enterprise technologies to implement the system, such as JSF, Persistence
API, EJB, container managed entity manager, input validation, Criteria API and JPQL.
